ESP8266-based open smart parking system.

# Introduction
Parkopticon started as a university project to build a prototype smart parking system. Right now the idea is to keep developing it until it becomes a full-fledged, wholly integrated one, as well as to use it as a playground to improve my engineering and system design skills.

Actual documentation coming very very soonâ„¢.
